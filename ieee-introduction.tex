\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%% 1. Talk about renewable energy and its variability - motivacao da importancia do estudo da probability forecasting OK

Renewable energy power is an emergent topic which is demanding attention from the academic community. %It is a much cleaner way of producing energy than by using other sources such as coal and gas, and with less hazard potential than nuclear power plants. 
The installed capacity of renewable energy plants has been increasing in a fast pace and projections point out that wind power alone will account to 18\% of global power by 2050  \cite{IntEnerAgency}.
In spite of its virtues, several new challenges are inherent when dealing with such power source, due to its unpredictability. To overcome this lack of certainty, one has to work with many different possibilities of outcome.

%Many applications in Power Systems use renewable scenarios as input.
%For all the aforementioned applications, the knowledge of the time series conditional distribution can provide all that needed information.
New statistical models capable of handling such difficulties are an emerging field in power systems literature \cite{zhang_review_2014 , bessa2012time, gallego2016line,moller_time-adaptive_2008,nielsen2006,bremnes_probabilistic_2004,wan_direct_2017} 
The main objective in such literature is to propose new models capable of generating scenarios of renewable generation (RG) which are demanded in (i) energy trading, (ii) unit commitment, (iii) grid expansion planning, and (iv) investment decisions (see (\cite{moreiraStreet,jabr2013robust,zhaoguan,Aderson2017}) and references therein). 
In stochastic optimization, problems such as Unit Commitment, Economic Dispatch, Transmission Expansion Planning all use scenarios as input. 
Such scenarios are used to characterize the probability distribution within the optimization under uncertainty framework.
When working with robust optimization, bounds for probable ranges of coefficients are needed.

%Having better prediction models can help the planner to make better and less risky decisions, increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy to the energy system.

%% Eu faço a introdução ao probabilistic forecasting
Conventional statistical models are often focused on estimating the conditional mean of a given random variable. % This is not very useful when dealing with renewable energy, as the variability and the notion of risk is extremely important for planning. - ver a distribuicao como um todo - reescrever
%One of the first works in wind power prediction, \cite{brown_time_1984} treated the nonlinearity of wind power by applying a transformation on the prediction of wind speed, which is modeled by an autoregressive process. The data is standardized to account for the normal variation during the day.
%\cite{moeanaddin_numerical_1990} estimated the $k$-step-ahead conditional density function using the Chapman-Kolmorov relation. The method is applied on a non-linear autoregressive time series.
By reducing the outcome to a single statistic, we loose important informations about the time series random behavior. In order to account for the process inherent variability it is important to consider probability forecasting.
In \cite{zhang_review_2014}, reviews the commonly used methodologies regarding probabilistic forecasting models, splitting them in parametric and nonparametric classes. Main characteristics of \textbf{parametric models} are (i) assuming a distribution shape and (ii) low computational costs. ARIMA-GARCH, for example, model the RG series by assuming the distribution \textit{a priori}. On the other hand, \textbf{nonparametric models} (i) don't require a distribution to be specified, (ii) needs more data to produce a good approximation and (iii) have a higher computational cost. Popular methods are Quantile Regression (QR), Kernel Density Estimation,  Artificial Intelligence or a mix of them.

Most time series methods rely on the assumption of Gaussian errors. However, RG time series such as wind and solar are reported as non-Gaussian \cite{bessa2012time,jeon2012using,taylor2015forecasting,Wan2017}. To circumvent this problem, the usage of nonparametric methods - which does not rely on assuming any previously assumed distribution - is adequate. 
Quantile Regression (QR) is a tool for constructing a methodology for non-gaussian time series, because of its facility to implement on commercial solvers and to extend the original model.
However, when estimating a distribution function, as each quantile is estimated independently, the monotonicity of the distribution function may be violated.
This issue - also known as crossing quantiles - can be adressed by constraining the sequence of quantiles to be in an increasing order. Other possibility is making a transformation afterwards, as shown in \cite{chernozhukov_quantile_2010}.

%%%%% 4. Falar de regressao quantilica em geral. Onde é utilizada e etc.


The seminal work \cite{koenker1978regression} defines QR as we use today. By this formulation, the conditional quantile is the solution of an optimization problem where we minimize the sum of the check function (defined formally in the next session). Instead of using the classical regression to estimate the conditional mean, the QR determines any quantile from the conditional distribution. Applications are enormous, ranging from risk measuring at financial funds (the Value-at-Risk) to a central measure robust to outliers.
By estimating many quantiles on a thin grid of probabilities, one can have as many points as desired from the estimated conditional distribution function. 
In \cite{koenker_quantile_2006}, the application of QR is extended to time series, when the covariates are lagged values of $y_t$.  
In our work, beyond autoregressive terms, it is also considered other exogenous variables as covariates. 



%%%%% 5. aplicações de QR em wind power, colocando os papers mais proximos.

In \cite{gallego2016line,moller_time-adaptive_2008,nielsen2006,bremnes_probabilistic_2004,wan_direct_2017}, QR is employed to model the conditional distribution of Wind Power Time Series.
An updating quantile regression model is presented by \cite{moller_time-adaptive_2008}. The authors present a modified version of the simplex algorithm to incorporate new observations without restarting the optimization procedure.
%Using existing wind power forecasting to extend these forecasting to build a model of quantiles is the strategy adopted by \cite{nielsen2006}.
In \cite{nielsen2006}, the authors build a quantile model from already existent independent Wind Power forecasts.
The approach by \cite{gallego2016line} is to use QR with a nonparametric methodology. The authors add a penalty term based on the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, which allows a nonlinear relationship between the explanatory variables and the output. This paper also develops an on-line learning technique, where the model is easily updated after each new observation.
In \cite{wan_direct_2017}, wind power probabilistic forecasts are made by using QR with a special type of Neural Network (NN) with one hidden layer, called extreme learning machine. In this setup, each quantile is a different linear combination of the features of the hidden layer.
The authors of \cite{cai_regression_2002} use the weighted Nadaraya-Watson to estimate the conditional function in the time series.

Regularization is a topic already explored in previous QR papers.
The work by \cite{belloni_l1-penalized_2009} defines the properties and convergence rates for QR when adding a penalty proportional to the $\ell_1$-norm to perform variable selection, using the same idea as the LASSO \cite{tibshirani1996regression}. The ADALASSO equivalent to QR has its properties investigated by \cite{ciuperca_adaptive_2016}. In this variant, the penalty for each variable has a different weight, and this modification ensures that the oracle property is being respected. 
In \cite{zou_regularized_2008,jiang_interquantile_2014}, the AdaLASSO is employed to QR with multiple quantile regressions at the same time, relating the estimated coefficients of different quantiles.

In this work we propose the use of a non parametric technique, which as already mentioned is free from user distribuitional specification, to simulate future scenarios of wind power generation. Such technique relies on a quantile autoregressive (QAR) framework in the same spirit as \cite{koenker1978regression,koenker_quantile_2006,koenker2005quantile}. Notwithstanding, as an innovation from the referenced works, in order to capture which variables would improve model fit, from a set of relevant ones, we propose the use of a LASSO cost function plus an interquantile term. Such term acts as a filter to impose coefficient stability for a given covariate across the set of quantiles. In addition, interquantile dependency is explored as in \cite{zou_regularized_2008,jiang_interquantile_2014}. As a second innovative feature of this work, we propose the inclusion of a penalization parameter in the second difference. We argue that such strategy avoids extreme quantiles to be shrinked to zero as fast as the central ones. For the best of the authors knowledge, no other work has developed a methodology where regularization and estimation of the conditional distribution using QR is carried on at the same time with the objective of generating future scenarios for WPG time series.

%The crossing quantile issue is solved by introducing a constraint on the optimization problems that forces the quantile function monotonicity. Furthermore, in the quantile regression literature for wind forecasting, a sequence of quantiles is provided as output. In our work, we propose to estimate the conditional distribution as a whole.


 
%%%%%% 7. Objetivos do paper e contribuição
The objective of this paper is, then, to propose a new methodology to address nonparametric time-series model focused on RG. This may be seen as a multiple quantile regression problem that specifies a time series model based on the empirical conditional distribution. The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A nonparametric methodology to model the conditional distribution of RG time series to produce scenarios.
	
	\item The proposition of a methodology that selects the global optimal solution with parsimony both on the selection of covariates as on the quantiles. This methodology is based on the Adaptive LASSO for QR (Linear Programming).
	
	\item Regularization techniques applied to an ensemble of quantile functions to estimate the conditional distribution, solving the issue of non-crossing quantiles. On regularizing quantiles, we propose a smoothness on the coefficient value across the sequence of quantiles.	
	%\item A nonlinear QR
	
\end{itemize}

%We propose a new combination of methods to predict the $k$-step ahead conditional distribution. By using MILP, we achieve a solution which is optimal for the given objective. In order to improve the quality of predictions and interpretability, we incorporate a joint regularization by specifying the existence of groups among the probabilities $\alpha$. We could not find any other work in the literature that interpreted different quantiles as models depending on one another. 
%The objective of this paper is to propose and test different techniques of predicting the conditional distribution based on QR.
