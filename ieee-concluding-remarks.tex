\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this paper, we propose a QR based methodology with regularization both on the quantile and on the covariates to produce future scenarios of RG. These scenarios are input for various applications in power systems and are essential in measuring risk in energy trading, planning the expansion of the energy systems and the dispatch problem. This nonparametric framework is specially useful when the data is not distributed according to a known distribution. The scenarios generated outperformed other known benchmarks, both in the QR litterature (the Koenker model) as in the classic time series framework (SARIMA). The results obtained in this paper brings incentives continue researching methods for nongaussian time series, as they are present in many real world applications.
